  # Tells transaction tracer and error collector (when enabled) whether or not
  # to capture HTTP params.

  # When true, the RoR filter_parameters mechanism is used so that sensitive
  # parameters are not recorded
  capture_params: false

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the RPM service once a minute. Included in
  # the transaction is the exact call sequence of the transactions including
  # any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it
    # off. This feature is only available at the Silver and above product
    # levels.
    enabled: true

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be recorded.
    # The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no SQL, "raw" which sends
    # the SQL statement in its original form, and "obfuscated", which strips
    # out numeric and string literals
    record_sql: raw

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL call. In
    # other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold, then capture and
    # send to RPM the current stack trace. This is helpful for pinpointing
    # where long SQL calls originate from
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.500

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends
  # them to RPM for viewing
  error_collector:

    # Error collector is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off.
    # This feature is only available at the Silver and above product levels
    enabled: true

    # Tells error collector whether or not to capture a source snippet around
    # the place of the error when errors are View related.

    # To stop specific errors from reporting to RPM, set this property to comma
    # separated values

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic conifguration settings for these enviromnents here.

  # NOTE: for initial evaluation purposes, you may want to temporarily turn
  # the agent on in development mode.

  # When running in Developer Mode, the New Relic Agent will present 
  # performance information on the last 100 transactions you have 
  # executed since starting the mongrel.  to view this data, go to

  # it almost never makes sense to turn on the agent when running unit,
  # functional or integration tests or the like.
  enabled: false

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring.  NewRelic testing shows
# an average performance impact of < 5 ms per transaction, you you can leave
# this on all the time without incurring any user-visible performance
